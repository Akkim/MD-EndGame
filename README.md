# MD-EndGame
End-game enhancement for Massive Darkness.

Based on the groundwork from Quiarcus @ BoardGameGeek - I have taken some time to convert his documents, polish them up a bit - working to make the text consistent.  

I have added some cards to make all of the decks a little more robust and consistent as well as adding another Boss class to round it out to an Even 12.

I will start to work on the rules and foundations as well - but for now it's mostly been the "Printables" that have had my focus first.
